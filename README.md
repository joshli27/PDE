# PDE

Identifying unknown differential equations from a given set of discrete time dependent data is a challenging problem. A small amount of noise can make the recovery unstable, and nonlinearity and differential equations with varying coefficients add complexity to the problem. We assume that the governing partial differential equation (PDE) is a linear combination of a subset of a prescribed dictionary containing different differential terms, and the objective of this paper is to find the correct coefficients.

We propose a new direction based on the fundamental idea of convergence analysis of numer- ical PDE schemes. We utilize Lasso for efficiency, and a performance guarantee is established based on an incoherence property.

This part of the algorithm models data generated by the 1-D Burger's equation.
